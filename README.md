Optimization-Backend
====================

An experimental (but robust) optimization backend plugin for the Mindc compiler. The optimizations are expressed by the mean of architectural annotations, and code generation uses new StringTemplates such as optimized macros for calls, and various component structures metadata will not be generated at compile-time, leading to a smaller footprint in text and data.
